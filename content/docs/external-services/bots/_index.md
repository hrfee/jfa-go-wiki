# Chatbots

jfa-go can send messages (password resets, announcements, etc.) via Email and/or chatbots for Discord, Telegram & Matrix.

The linking process for each requires verification (a PIN sent to the user essentially), so you can require any of these at sign-up as a security feature.

Users can also link their accounts later via the "My Account" page.

You can choose which specific methods to use for a Jellyfin user on the Accounts page once you've connected an email address or user to them.

Setup varies in difficulty, see the sidebar for guides on each.
