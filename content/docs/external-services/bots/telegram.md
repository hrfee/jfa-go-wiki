# Telegram bot setup

To use the Telegram integration, you must create a Telegram bot through their odd bot interface. It's one of the easiest ones to set up.

## Instructions

* Message the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) with `/newbot` to start creating a bot.
* Follow the prompts to choose a name and username.
* Once complete, you will be given an HTTP API Key. In jfa-go, go to Settings > Telegram, enable it and paste the API Key into the `API Token` box, then save and restart.

You should now be able to be able to add Telegram users on the accounts tab, and be able to link them on the sign-up page.
