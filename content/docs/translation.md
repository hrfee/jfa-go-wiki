# Translation

If you'd like to help out and speak a language other than English, you can help translate. Visit the [weblate](https://weblate.hrfee.pw) instance and login with GitHub to start adding. Everything except settings is now translatable.

If you need help, email me or comment on issue [#12](https://github.com/hrfee/jfa-go/issues/12).
