# jfa-go wiki

Stuff here will apply to the latest git version, but will probably work on older versions.
If you desperately need info for an older version, browse through the commits to find one around the same time as the version's release.

You can find the source for this wiki [here](https://github.com/hrfee/jfa-go-wiki).

If you think something's missing here, feel free to make a PR.

If you have any questions that aren't answered here or need help, create a new Discussion on github [here](https://github.com/hrfee/jfa-go/discussions/new).
